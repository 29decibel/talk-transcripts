Similar to the slide in Stu's Ions talk at time 6:44, but not
identical because Rich's has "your app here" in the circle in the
middle.

only difference is that in Rich's talk, there is a dotted line from
API Gateway to Datomic Cloud, that does not go through the AWS
Lambdas, labeled "on the agenda", which Rich refers to as something
they are planning to enable in Datomic Cloud.]
